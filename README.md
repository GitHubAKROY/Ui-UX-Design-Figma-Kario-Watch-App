Describtion:

Project: Kario Wellness Watch

A design prototype for a wellness-focused smartwatch, conceptualized in Figma. This project aims to envision a modern wearable that helps users track their health metrics, manage wellness, and stay motivated. It includes UI/UX flows, visual design elements, and branding for the smartwatch and companion app.

Key Features / Components

Dashboard / Home Screen
Displays core health metrics at a glance: steps, heart rate, sleep, etc. Likely includes progress tracking (daily, weekly) so users can see how they’re doing.

Activity / Fitness Tracking
Interfaces for tracking different types of activity (walking, running, etc.), with metrics such as duration, distance, calories burned.

Sleep Monitoring
Screens showing sleep duration, quality (e.g. deep/light sleep), perhaps a sleep summary or trends over time.

Heart Rate Monitoring
Real-time heart rate measurement display, maybe alert or average/resting heart rate, possibly with charts.

Wellness / Insights
Sections that give feedback or suggestions (e.g. to move more, rest more), trends over time, possibly reminders or goals.

Profile / Settings
User settings for personalizing the watch/app: units, notifications, display options, connectivity, etc.

Visual / UI Style
Clean and modern design aesthetic, likely using minimalistic layouts, clear typography, consistent iconography. Probably a color palette aimed at health/wellness feel (calming / energetic tones). Smooth transitions and intuitive interactions.

Prototype Flows
User flows for setting up the watch, navigating between screens, viewing detailed information (e.g. past activity or sleep history), adjusting settings.

Purpose & Goals

To create a visually compelling, intuitive smartwatch UX that supports health & wellness goals.

To experiment with wearable interface design—balancing simplicity (fit for small screen) with providing valuable feedback and insights.

To showcase ability in UI design, prototyping, and interaction design in the context of wearable technology.
